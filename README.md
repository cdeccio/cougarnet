# Cougarnet

Cougarnet creates a virtual network for learning network configuration and
protocols.  It takes as input a [network configuration
file](#network-configuration-file).  Using the configuration as a guide, it
creates [virtual hosts](#virtual-hosts) and [virtual links](#virtual-links)
between them.  It can also add MAC and IP address information to interfaces,
specify bandwidth, (propagation) delay, or loss to links.

Perhaps the most power feature of Cougarnet is the ability to either use the
built-in Linux network stack or capture raw frames only.  The former is useful
for configuring and using a network with built-in tools (e.g., `ping`,
`traceroute`), while the latter is useful for implementing the protocol stack in
software.  Additionally, there can be a mixture--some hosts that use native
stack and some that do not.

# Installation

The following are dependencies for Cougarnet:

 - [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/)
 - [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/)
 - [LXTerminal](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXTerminal)
 - [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/)
 - [Graph::Easy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Graph::Easy)
 - [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) - (optional, but recommended)
 - [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) - (used only in examples in the documentation)

To install these on a Debian system, run the following:

```
$ sudo apt install openvswitch-switch lxterminal python3-pygraphviz libgraph-easy-perl wireshark socat
```

Of course, this assumes that you already have `sudo` installed and that your user is
allowed to call it.

Additionally, `sudo` should be configured such that your user can call it without requiring a
password (i.e., with the `NOPASSWD` option).

To install Cougarnet, run the following:

```bash
$ python3 setup.py build
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```


# Getting Started

To get started, create a simple network configuration.  Create a file called
`simple-net.cfg` with the following contents:

```
NODES
h1
h2

LINKS
h1,10.0.0.1/24 h2,10.0.0.2/24
```

This simple configuration results in a network composed of two nodes, named
`h1` and `h2`.  There is a single link between them.  For the link between `h1`
and `h2`, `h1`'s interface will have an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.1, and `h2` will
have an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.2.  The `/24` indicates that the length of the
IPv4 prefix associated with that link is 24 bit associated with that link is 24
bits, i.e., 10.0.0.0/24.

Start Cougarnet with this configuration by running the following command:

```bash
$ cougarnet simple-net.cfg
```

When it starts up, it will launch two new terminals.  One will be associated
with the virtual host `h1` and the other with `h2`.  The prompt at each should
indicate which is which.

Each each terminal, run the following to see the network configuration:

```bash
$ ip addr
```

Then run the following on each to see the hostname:

```bash
$ hostname
```

Note first that each virtual host sees only its own interface. Also note that
each host is configured with the address from the configuration file.

Next, from the `h2` terminal, run the following:

```bash
h2$ sudo tcpdump -l
```

(Note that in this example and elsewhere in this document `h2$` simply
indicates that it is the prompt corresponding to `h2`.)

The `-l` option to `tcpdump` ensures that line-based buffering is used, so the
output is printed as soon as it is generated.

Now from the `h1` terminal, run the following:

```bash
h1$ ping h2
```

You should see activity on both terminals.  The `tcpdump` output on `h2` shows
the ICMP packets resulting from the `ping` command issued on `h1`, as well as
the responses being returned by `h2`.  The `ping` output on `h1` shows the
status of the ICMP messages leaving `h1` and the response messages coming from
`h2`.

Now, enter `Ctrl`+`c` on each terminal to stop the two programs.  Finally,
return to the terminal on which you ran the `cougarnet` command, and enter
`Ctrl`+`c`.

Congratulations!  You have just completed a simple Cougarnet excercise!


# Virtual Hosts

Each virtual host is actually just a process that is running in its own Linux
namespace (see the `man` page for `namespaces(7)`).  Specifically, it is a
process spawned with the `unshare` command.  The `--mount`, `--net`, and
`--uts` options are passed to `unshare` command, the result of which is that
(respectively):
 - any filesystem mounts created (i.e., with the `mount` command) are only seen
   by the process, not by the whole system;
 - the network stack, including interfaces, address configuration, firewall,
   and more, are specific to the process and are not seen by the rest of the
   system; and
 - the hostname is specific to the process.

With only these options in use, the virtual hosts all still have access to the
system-wide filesystem and all system processes (Note that the former could be
changed if `unshare` were called with `--root`, and the latter could be changed
if `unshare` were called with `--pid`, but currently that is not an option).


## Configuration

In the Cougarnet configuration file, a host is designated by a hostname on a
single line in the `NODES` section of the file. Consider the `NODES` section of
the [example configuration given previously](#getting-started):

```
NODES
h1
h2
```

This creates two virtual hosts, `h1` and `h2` with their
[hostnames](#hostnames) set accordingly.


### Additional Options

Additional options can be specified for any host.  For example, we might like
to provide `h1` with additional configuration, such as the following:

```
NODES
h1 gw4=10.0.0.4,terminal=false
h2
```

In this case, 10.0.0.4 has been designated as the default IPv4 gateway for
`h1`, and no terminal will be started for `h1` as would normally be the case.

In general, the syntax for a host is:

```
<hostname> [name=val[,name=val[...]]
```

That is, if there are additional options, there is a space after the hostname,
and those options come after the space. The options consist a comma-delimited
list of name-value pairs, each name-value connected by `=`.  The defined host
option names are the following, accompanied by the expected value:
 - `gw4`: an IPv4 address representing the gateway or default router.  Example:
   `10.0.0.4`.  Default: no IPv4 gateway.
 - `gw6`: an IPv6 address representing the gateway or default router.  Example:
   `fd00::4`.  Default: no IPv6 gateway.
 - `native_apps`: a boolean (i.e., `true` or `false`) indicating whether or not
   the native network stack should be used.  Default: `true`.
 - `terminal`: a boolean (i.e., `true` or `false`) indicating whether or not a
   terminal should be spawned.  Sometimes neither an interactive interface with
   a virtual host nor console output is necessary, in which case `false` would
   be appropriate.  An example of this is if a script is designated to be run
   automatically with the host using the `prog` attribute.  Default: `true`.
 - `type`: a string representing the type of node.  The supported types are:
   `host`, `switch`, `router`.  Default: `host`.
 - `prog`: a string representing a program and its arguments, which are to be
   run, instead of an interactive shell.  The program path and its arguments
   are delimited by `|`.  For example, `echo|foo|bar` would execute
   `echo foo bar`.  Default: execute an interactive shell.


## Hostnames

When started, the hostname of a virtual host is set according to the name given
in the configuration.  This can be seen in the title of the terminal as well as
the command-line prompt.  You can also retrieve the hostname by simply running
the following from the command line:

```bash
$ hostname
```

Or it can be retrieved using Python with the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import socket
hostname = socket.gethostname()
```


## Interface Names

The interface names for a given [link](#virtual-links) are derived from the
name of the current host and the host it connects to on that link.  For
example, if there is a link connecting host `h1` and host `h2`, then the `h1`'s
interface will be called `h1-h2`, and `h2`'s interface will be callsed `h2-h1`.
That helps greatly with identification.  The interfaces for a host, and their
respective configurations, can be viewed by running the following from the
command line:

```bash
$ ip addr
```

The interface names alone can be retrieved by listing the contents of the
special directory `/sys/class/net`.  For example:

```bash
$ ls /sys/class/net
```

Or to show all interfaces except loopback interfaces (i.e., starting with `lo`):

```bash
$ ls -l /sys/class/net | awk '$9 !~ /^lo/ { print $9 }'
```

The equivalent Python code is the following:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
ints = [i for i in os.listdir('/sys/class/net/') if not i.startswith('lo')]
```


## Communicating with the Calling Process

Often it is useful for the virtual host to send messages back to the process
that invoked all the virtual hosts (i.e., the `cougarnet` process).  This
enables the logs for all messages to be received and printed in a single
location.  To accomplish this, each virtual process has the
`COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK`  environment variable set, the value of which is a path
corresponding to a UNIX domain socket (i.e., family `AF_UNIX`) of type
`SOCK_DGRAM`.  Once all the virtual machines are started, the `cougarnet`
process will print to standard output all messages received on this socket.

For example, the following command, issued from a virtual host, will result in
a UDP datagram being sent to the UNIX domain socket on which the `cougarnet`
process is listening.

```bash
$ echo -n `hostname`,hello world | socat - UNIX-SENDTO:$COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK
```

The equivalent Python code is the following:

```python
import os
import socket

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, 0)
sock.connect(os.environ['COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK'])
hostname = socket.gethostname()
sock.send(f'{hostname},hello world'.encode('utf-8'))
```

The `cougarnet` process will print a single line of output that will look
something like this:

```
13.766   h1  hello world
```

The three components of the output message can be explained as follows:
 - *Relative time* (`13.766`): the relative time, i.e., the number of seconds
   that have elapsed since the virtual hosts were started by the `cougarnet`
   process.
 - *Hostname* (`h1`): the hostname of the virtual host from which the message
   was sent.  Note that the hostname must be sent by the virtual host.  It is
   done by prepending the hostname, separating it from the actual message with
   a comma.  Thus, the following message in the previous example:
   ```bash
   echo -n `hostname`,hello world
   ```
 - *Message* (`hello world`): the actual message to be logged and/or printed.

The `rawpkt.BaseFrameHandler` class has a function `log()` which can be used to
issue messages.  So if you subclass `rawpkt.BaseFrameHandler` and then call
`log()`, it will handle the formatting for you.


## Name Resolution

When the `native_apps` option is used in a host configuration, or when the
`--native-apps` option is used on the command line, a virtual host has access
to `/etc/hosts`, which contains a mapping of the names and IP addresses of all
virtual hosts in the virtual network.  That allows apps such as `ping` to use
hostname instead of IP address exclusively (see the [example given
previously](#getting-started)).


## Host Types

The host types (i.e., `host`, `router`, `switch`) are intended to give special
behavior to the virtual host, depending on the type.  Currently, however, only
hosts of type `switch` have special meaning.  See [VLAN
Attributes](#vlan-attributes) for more.


## Default Gateway

The default IPv4 or IPv6 gateway can be set using the `gw4` or `gw6` options,
respectively.  At the moment, the only result is that the following environment
variables are set in the virtual host:
`COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV4` and `COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV6`.


## Environment

In the virtual host process, certain environment variables are set to help
processes running within the virtual host have better context of their network
environment.  All environment variables start with `COUGARNET_`.  The
environment variables currently defined are:

 - `COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK`:
   described [here](#communicating-with-the-calling-process)
 - `COUGARNET_VLAN_H1_H2`, etc.:
   described [here](#vlan-attributes) and [here](#interface-names)
 - `COUGARNET_TRUNK_H1`, etc.:
   described [here](#vlan-attributes) and [here](#interface-names)
 - `COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV4`, `COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV6`:
   described [here](#default-gateway)

They can be retrieved from a running process in the standard way.  For example,
from command line:

```bash
$ echo $COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK
```

or from Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
print(os.environ['COUGARNET_COMM_SOCK'])
```

## Running Programs

When a program is specified with the `prog` attribute, that program will be
executed in the virtual host, instead of the standard shell being executed (the
default).  Furthermore, programs from all virtual hosts are intended to start
at *approximately* the same time--though there is some non-determinism as to
their *exact* timing.

If `terminal` is enabled for a given host (the default), or the `--terminal
all` option is used on the command line, then the program will have access to
the standard input, standard output, and standard error.

In either case (terminal or not), the program will have access to all the
[environment variables](#environment-variables) associated with the virtual
host.

Suppose `loop.sh` (in the current directory) contains the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
hostname
echo $COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV4
echo $1
for i in {1..3}; do
    echo $i
    sleep 1
done
```

And `cougarnet` is run with the following configuration:

```
NODES
h1 prog=./loop.sh|hello,gw4=10.0.0.4
```

The result would be the following:

```
h1
10.0.0.4
hello
1
2
3
```

The equivalent Python code would be:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os
import socket
import sys
import time
print(socket.gethostname())
print(os.environ['COUGARNET_DEFAULT_GATEWAY_IPV4'])
print(sys.argv[1])
for i in range(1, 4):
    print(i)
    time.sleep(1)
```

The output is the same as the previous output.


## Sending and Receiving Frames

When Cougarnet is used for protocol development, it is desirable to send and
receive raw Ethernet frames, rather than using the native network stack, i.e.,
with the socket API.  Two classes are useful for sending and receiving frames
in Cougarnet: `rawpkt.BaseFrameHandler` and `networksched.NetworkEventLoop`.


### `BaseFrameHandler`

The `BaseFrameHandler` class provides functionality to a virtual host to
facilitate frame sending and receiving.  The key components are the following:

 - `int_to_sock` - a `dict` containing a mapping of
   [interface names](#interface-names) to raw sockets (i.e., for sending
   frames).
 - `hostname` - a `str` whose value is the [hostname](#hostnames) of the virtual host.
 - `comm_sock` - a socket (`socket.socket`) that is connected to the
   [communications socket](#communicating-with-the-calling-process) on which
   the calling `cougarnet` process is listening (i.e., for logging).
 - `get_first_interface()` - returns the name of one of the interfaces on the
   virtual host.  This is useful when the device really has just one interface,
   to make it easily retrievable.  Note that `first` is probably a misnomer.
 - `send_frame(frame, intf)` - send frame (type `bytes`) out on the interface
   designated by name `intf`, a `str`.  Generally calling this method is
   preferred over calling `sendto()` on a socket  directly.
 - `log(msg)` - send message `msg` (type `str`) to the communications socket.
   Generally calling this method is preferred over calling `sendto()` on the
   communications socket (i.e., `comm_sock`) directly.

This is designed to provide a base class, which can be subclassed, such that
the inherited functionality is accessible to the child class.  For example,

```python
class FramePrinter(BaseFrameHandler):
    def print_frame_repr(self, intf, frame):
        self.log(f'Received frame: {repr(frame)}')
```


### `NetworkEventLoop`

The `NetworkEventLoop` class provides a way for a process to handle incoming
frames and scheduled events to be handled by an event loop.  In short, the
`NetworkEventLoop` is instantiated with a function or bound method that is to
be called when a frame is received, such as:

```python
def print_frame_repr(intf, frame):
    print(f'Received frame: {repr(frame)}')

event_loop = NetworkEventLoop(print_frame_repr)
event_loop.run()
```

or, using a subclass of `BaseFrameHandler`:

```python
class FramePrinter(BaseFrameHandler):
    def print_frame_repr(self, intf, frame):
        self.log(f'Received frame: {repr(frame)}')

frame_printer = FramePrinter()
event_loop = NetworkEventLoop(frame_printer.print_frame_repr)
event_loop.run()
```

In both examples the argument used in the instantiation and initialization
of a `NetworkEventLoop` instance is a function (or bound method) that takes
two arguments:

 - `frame` (type `bytes`) - the frame received; and
 - `intf` (type `str`) - the name of the interface out which it should be sent.

Thus, when an incoming frame `frame` arrives on interface `intf`, the
following is called by the `NetworkEventLoop` instance:

```python
handle_frame(frame, intf)
```

where `handle_frame()` represents the function that was passed.


#### Scheduling Events

Events (besides incoming packets) are added to the event loop by calling
`schedule_event()` method, which is defined thus:

```python
def schedule_event(self, seconds, action, args=None, kwargs=None):
```

The arguments are as follows:
 - `seconds` (type `float`) - a time relative to the current time (i.e., to
   designate that something should happen `seconds` seconds from now).
 - `action` (type `callable`) - the function or bound method that should be
   called at the designated time.
 - `args` (type `tuple` or `None`) - one or more arguments that should be
   passed to the function or bound method when it is called.
 - `kwargs` (type `dict` or `None`) - one or more keyword arguments that should
   be passed to the function or bound method when it is called.

For example, consider the following:

```python
event_loop = NetworkEventLoop(handle_frame)

def say_hello(arg):
    print(f'hello {arg}')

event_loop.schedule_event(2, say_hello, ('world',))
event_loop.run()
```

This would result in "hello world" being printed two seconds after
`event_loop.run()` was called.  A perpetual event could happen by running the
following:

```python
event_loop = NetworkEventLoop(handle_frame)

def say_hello(arg):
    print(f'hello {arg}')
    event_loop.schedule_event(2, say_hello, ('world',))

event_loop.schedule_event(2, say_hello, ('world',))
event_loop.run()
```

This would result in `say_hello()` being called every two seconds.  Note that
is not a recursive call because `say_hello()` is not calling `say_hello()`; it
is simply scheduling `say_hello()` to be called later.


#### Canceling Events

Canceling a scheduled event is done with the `cancel_event()` method.  When an
event is scheduled by calling `schedule_event()`, an `Event` instance is
returned.  That instance is passed to `cancel_event()`.  Consider the previous
example:

```python
event_loop = NetworkEventLoop(handle_frame)

def say_hello(arg):
    print(f'hello {arg}')

event = event_loop.schedule_event(2, say_hello, ('world',))
event_loop.cancel_event(event)
event_loop.run()
```

The call to `say_hello()` is cancelled before it ever gets run!


# Virtual Links

Virtual links are created between two virtual interfaces with the `ip link`
command, using type `veth`: such that one virtual interface is associated with
one network namespace and the second is associated with another network
namespace.  Those two namespaces are the two associated with two processes
 that are running in their own namespaces.  These processes, of course, are
[virtual hosts](#virtual-hosts), so these virtual links become the basis for
connections between virtual hosts.


## Configuration

In the Cougarnet configuration file, a link between two hosts is designated in
the `LINKS` section by indicating two hosts on a line, separated by a space.
Consider the `LINKS` section of the [example configuration given
previously](#getting-started):

```
LINKS
h1,10.0.0.1/24 h2,10.0.0.2/24
```

This results in a virtual interface being created for each virtual host.  More
on per-host interface naming can be found [here](#interface-names).


### Addressing

Each interface can be configured with zero or more addresses, up to one MAC
address and zero or more IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.  The list of addresses is
comma-separated.  For example, we might like to configure the `h1` and  `h2`
virtual interfaces thus:

```
LINKS
h1,00:00:aa:aa:aa:aa,10.0.0.1/24,fd00::1/64 h2,10.0.0.2/24,fd00::2/64
```

In this case, `h1`'s virtual network interface will not only have IPv4 address
10.0.0.1, but also MAC address 00:00:aa:aa:aa:aa and IPv6 address fd00::1/64.
Likewise, `h2`'s virtual network interface will have IPv6 address fd00::2/64,
in addition to IPv4 address 10.0.0.2.


### Additional Options

Additional options can be specified for any link.  For example, we might like
to provide the (original) link between `h1` and `h2` with additional
configuration, such as the following:

```
LINKS
h1,10.0.0.1/24 h2,10.0.0.2/24 bw=1Mbps,delay=20ms,loss=10%
```

In this case, the bandwidth of the link will be 1Mbps, instead of the default
10Gbps, an artificial delay of 20 ms will be applied to any packet crossing the
link, and an artificial packet loss rate of 10% will be applied to packets
crossing the link.  That is, any packet has a 10% chance of being dropped.

In general, the syntax for a link is:

```
<hostname>[,<addr>[,<addr>...]] <hostname>[,<addr>[,<addr>...]] [name=val[,name=val[...]]
```

That is, if there are additional options, there is a space after the interface
information for the second host, and those options come after the space. The
options consist a comma-delimited list of name-value pairs, each name-value
connected by `=`.  The defined link option names are the following, accompanied
by the expected value:
 - `bw`:  an artificial bandwith to apply to the link.  Example: `1Mbps`.
   Default: `10Gbps`.
 - `delay`: an artificial delay to be added to all packets on the link.
   Example: `50ms`.  Default: no delay.
 - `loss`: an average rate of artificial loss that should be applied
   to the link.  Example: `10%`.  Default: no loss.
 - `mtu`: the number of bytes associated with the maximum transmission unit
   (MTU).  Example: `500`.  Default: `1500`.
 - `vlan`: the VLAN id (integer with value 0 through 1023) associated with the
   link.  Example: `20`.  Default: no VLAN id.
 - `trunk`: a boolean (i.e., `true` or `false`) indicating whether this link
   should be a trunk link between two switches, such that 802.1Q frames are
   passed on that link.  Default: `false`.

Note that for a given switch, one of the following must be true:
 - all interfaces must be either trunked (i.e., `trunk=true`) or have a
   designated VLAN (e.g., `vlan=10`); or
 - no interfaces must be trunked or have a designated VLAN.

The former case is a more modern example of a switch, where VLANs are the norm,
and the latter is an example of a simple switch.


## Bi-Directionality of Link Attributes

A note about the link-specific attributes.  They are applied in both
directions.  Thus, using the example configuration above, running a `ping`
command between `h1` and `h2` will result in something like this:

```
h2$ ping -c 10 h1
PING h1 (10.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=41.5 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=41.3 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=41.1 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=6 ttl=64 time=40.8 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=40.8 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=41.8 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=9 ttl=64 time=41.4 ms
64 bytes from h1 (10.0.0.1): icmp_seq=10 ttl=64 time=41.3 ms

--- h1 ping statistics ---
10 packets transmitted, 8 received, 20% packet loss, time 9061ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 40.811/41.242/41.775/0.306 ms
```

Note that the round-trip time (RTT) was consistently around just over 40 ms
(i.e., 20 ms for the ICMP request and 20 ms for the ICMP response).  Also, any
packet has a 10% chance of being lost.  Because a successful `ping` requires
the successful transmission of both an ICMP request and the corresponding ICMP
response, the chance of success is 81%:

```
P(success)
  = P(neither pkt is lost)
  = (1 - P(loss)) * (1 - P(loss))
  = (1 - 0.10) * (1 - 0.10)
  = 0.81
```

In other words, 1 in 5 ICMP request messages sent will not result in an ICMP
response message received.  In the example above, `ping` messages with id
numbers 1 and 3 were unsuccessful.


## VLAN Attributes

The behavior resulting from setting the `vlan` and `trunk` attributes depends
on whether a switch has been configured for native apps (i.e., with the
`native_apps` configuration option or the `--native-apps` command-line option).

In either case, neither the `vlan` attribute nor the `trunk` attribute have any
effect unless at least one of the hosts is of type `switch`.

### Native Apps
In native apps mode, a virtual switch is created (using Open vSwitch), and the
links are assigned as designated VLAN or trunk links, respectively.

### Non-Native Apps
If `vlan` is specified for a switch, then the virtual switch is made aware of
the VLAN assignment via an environment variable.

In this case, the virtual switches are both made aware of the trunked link via
an environment variable.

For example, consider the following configuration.

```
NODES
h1
h2 type=switch
h3
h4 type=switch

LINKS
h1 h2 vlan=25
h2 h3 vlan=32
h2 h4 trunk=true
```

In this case, `h2` and `h3` are each switches, connected by a trunk.  Both `h1`
and `h3` are connected to `h2`, with their links having VLAN assignments 25 and
32, respectively.  The link between `h2` and `h4` is a trunk.  In this case,
the process associated with `h2` will have the following environment variables
set:

```bash
COUGARNET_VLAN_H2_H1=25
COUGARNET_VLAN_H2_H3=32
COUGARNET_TRUNK_H2_H4=true
```

Likewise, the process associated with `h4` will have the following environment
variables set:

```bash
COUGARNET_TRUNK_H4_H2=true
```


# Network Configuration File

The full syntax for the network configuration file is as follows:

```
HOSTS
[<hostname> [name=val[,name=val[...]]]
[...]

LINKS
[<hostname>[,<addr>[,<addr>...]] <hostname>[,<addr>[,<addr>...]] [name=val[,name=val[...]]]
[...]
```

Blank links and lines beginning with `#` (i.e., comments) are ignored.

See specifics in the [virtual host](#configuration) and [virtual
link](#configuration-1) configuration sections.


# Command-Line Usage

```
$ cougarnet --help
usage: cougarnet [-h] [--wireshark NODE] [--display] [--terminal {all,none}] [--native-apps {all,none}]
                 [--display-file DISPLAY_FILE]
                 config_file

positional arguments:
  config_file           File containing the network configuration

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --wireshark NODE, -w NODE
                        Start wireshark for the specified node
  --display             Display the network configuration as text
  --terminal {all,none}
                        Specify that all virtual hosts should launch (all) or not launch (none) a terminal.
  --native-apps {all,none}
                        Specify that all virtual hosts should enable (all) or disable (none) native apps.
  --display-file DISPLAY_FILE
                        Print the network configuration to a file (.png)

```

Note that `--terminal` and `--native-apps` options override all per-host
`terminal` and `native_apps` options.

Also note that the `--display-file` option is not yet fully-functional.
